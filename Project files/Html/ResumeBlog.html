<p id="p1">While writing a resume is undoubtedly challenging, there are certain CV faux pas that can be easily avoided to improve your application and chances for landing the job you want. Whether that means omitting third person or submitting two pages, the strongest resume shines a light on your unique skills and experience with succinct clarity.</p>
<p id="p1">That is where Philips recruiters come in. They have filled roles with the best talent for thousands of jobs and know exactly what to look for in prospective employees. Below are 5 of their essential resume dos and dont have that could bring you one step closer to taking the next big step in your career.</p>
<p id="p1"><b>1.&nbsp; A headshot wont give you a head start.</b></p>
<p id="p1">Save that valuable space on your resume for highlighting your professional accomplishments and achievements. A headshot opens the door to potential discrimination accusations that recruiters must stay away from.</p>
<p id="p1"><b>2.&nbsp; Two pages? Perfectly fine.</b></p>
<p id="p1">The old adage says: keep your resume to one page. But if you are a seasoned professional, it can make sense to write a two-page resume that encompasses your relevant work experience. If you have less professional experience, a single page is more than acceptable</p>
<p id="p1"><b>3.&nbsp; There is no place like home. So include it on your resume.</b></p>
<p id="p1">By adding your home residence to your resume, recruiters will know whether you will need to move to accept the job and potentially offer you money to relocate. Plus, if you land the position, your new company will have what it needs to generate a formal offer letter quickly.</p>
<p id="p1"><b>4.&nbsp; Keep employers&nbsp;linked in&nbsp;with&nbsp;your professional social media accounts.</b></p>
<p id="p1">By providing links to your career site profiles, such as&nbsp; LinkedIn, you are giving hiring managers a simplified snapshot of your experience and easy access to all your testimonials.</p>
<p id="p1"><b>5. Republican? Democrat? Save it for the voting booth.</b></p>
<p id="p1">Recruiters and hiring managers want to know whether you are qualified for the job at hand. Leave out personal information, such as your marital status, number of children, height and weight, birthday and political affiliation.</p>
