		<p id="p1">Being happy in your job can take many forms: great coworkers, competitive compensation, flexible work time, challenging projects. However, one trait that all happy employees share is a positive work-life balance. Feeling like you have a healthy amount of both achievement and enjoyment are crucial to being happiest at work and in someone personal life.</p>
		<p id="p1">With this in mind, we took a look at the work-life balance ratings for companies on Glassdoor to give us a sense of which companies have some of the happiest employees. In no particular order, here are 20 companies where employees are happy and fulfilled. Good news is that each of these companies is hiring. Do not spend another day in a boring job&nbsp; start working somewhere that makes you truly happy!</p>
		<p id="p1"><strong>RLI</strong><br>
		<b>Work-Life Balance Rating:</b> 4.8 out of 5<br>
		<b>Open Roles:</b> Claim Manager, IT Manager, Sr. User Experience Designer, Underwriting Internship, Business Analyst, Claims Consultant, Operations Supervisor &amp; more.<br>

		<b>What Employees Say:</b> Amazing service-focused community-like culture, smart people to work with, terrific (and sometimes surprising) benefits, interesting product lines, overall a cool company. I had highly recommend RLI as an employer  (Current Employee)</p>
