<p id="p1">For many job seekers, the interview process is the most stressful aspect of the job search. It can be even more intimidating to prepare if you know you are applying to a company that is notoriously tough on interviewing. How hard <i>really </i>will the interview be? Will it last for hours? How many stages are there? Do not panic! We have compiled 20 companies with challenging interview processes along with accounts and advice from job seekers who went through the interview stages and received an offer, so you can know how to anticipate and nail the interview. It is true, these interviews may be difficult for the uninformed job seeker; but by the end of the list, you will be prepared to walk into the interview with an edge on the competition. </p>
